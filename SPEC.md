# Unity2Godot Converter — V1 Specification

## Overview

A cross-platform desktop tool that converts a `.unitypackage` file into a ready-to-open Godot 4.6.1 project. V1 is limited to static meshes (FBX), textures, materials (URP + legacy), and scenes. No C# scripts, custom shaders, skinned meshes, animations, or audio.

**Target Godot version:** 4.6.1

---

## Architecture

- Cross-platform: **Windows, macOS, Linux**

### Dependencies (all vendored in `thirdparty/`)

| Library | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Dear ImGui** | GUI framework (immediate mode) |
| **GLFW** | Windowing/input backend for ImGui |

## Conversion Pipeline

### High-Level Flow

```
.unitypackage (tar.gz)
    │
    ▼
[1. Extract to temp dir]
    │
    ▼
[2. Build GUID → path table from all pathname + asset.meta files]
    │
    ▼
[3. Classify assets by type: scene, prefab, material, texture, FBX, other]
    │
    ▼
[4. Convert each asset type (order matters)]
    │   a. Textures → copy to output
    │   b. FBX → copy to output (Godot imports natively)
    │   c. Materials → convert to .tres files
    │   d. Prefabs → convert to .tscn files
    │   e. Scenes → convert to .tscn files
    │
    ▼
[5. Generate project.godot + folder structure]
    │
    ▼
[6. Produce skip report + cleanup temp dir]
```

### Threading Model

- Conversion runs on a **background worker thread**
- Progress callbacks update the ImGui UI on the main thread
- The worker reports: current phase, asset name, progress percentage, warnings/errors
- Cancellation is supported via an atomic flag checked between assets

---

## 1. Package Extraction

### Input Format

`.unitypackage` is a **tar.gz** archive. Inside, each asset is stored in a GUID-named folder:

```
<guid>/
    pathname    — text file containing the asset's Unity project path (e.g., "Assets/Models/building.fbx")
    asset       — the actual file data
    asset.meta  — Unity YAML with import settings, GUID declaration, etc.
    preview.png — optional thumbnail (ignored)
```

### Extraction Process

1. Decompress gzip layer using **miniz**
2. Read tar entries using a **custom tar reader** (~100 lines; tar is a trivial format of 512-byte header blocks followed by raw data)
3. Extract all entries to a **temporary directory**
4. Build GUID → path mapping table by reading every `pathname` file
5. Parse every `asset.meta` file to extract:
   - GUID (redundant with folder name but validates)
   - Asset type / importer type
   - Import settings (texture settings, FBX settings, etc.)
6. Temp directory is deleted after conversion completes (or on cancellation/error)

### Edge Cases

- **Prefab-only packages:** Some `.unitypackage` files contain only prefabs, textures, and models with no scenes. The converter handles this gracefully — all assets are converted normally, no `.tscn` scene files are produced, and `project.godot` is still generated. This is a valid output.
- **Missing `asset` data:** Some entries in a `.unitypackage` have a `pathname` and `asset.meta` but no `asset` file (e.g., folder entries, or assets excluded during export). These entries are added to the GUID table (for path resolution) but skipped during conversion with no warning — this is normal.
- **Path separators:** The `pathname` file may contain forward slashes or backslashes depending on the OS that created the package. All paths are normalized to forward slashes during extraction.

---

## 2. GUID Resolution

### GUID Table

A complete in-memory map is built **upfront** before any conversion begins:

```
Map<string, AssetEntry> guidTable;

struct AssetEntry {
    string guid;
    string unityPath;       // e.g., "Assets/Textures/brick_albedo.png"
    string tempFilePath;    // path to extracted asset data
    AssetType type;         // texture, fbx, material, scene, prefab, script, other
    MetaData meta;          // parsed import settings from .meta
};
```

### GUID + fileID References

Unity references assets via `{fileID: <id>, guid: <guid>, type: <type>}`. Resolution:

- **guid** → look up in the GUID table to find the asset
- **fileID** → identifies a sub-object within the asset (e.g., a specific mesh within an FBX, or a specific component). For FBX files, fileID is a deterministic hash of the sub-object name.
- **type** → 2 = native Unity asset, 3 = external asset (FBX, texture, etc.)

---

## 3. Unity YAML Parser

### Approach: Custom Lightweight Parser

Unity scene/prefab/material files use a **non-standard YAML 1.1 variant** with custom tags. Rather than fighting a YAML library, we build a purpose-built parser.

### Unity YAML Structure

```yaml
%YAML 1.1
%TAG !u! tag:unity3d.com,2011:
--- !u!1 &123456
GameObject:
  m_Name: MyObject
  m_Component:
  - component: {fileID: 123457}
--- !u!4 &123457
Transform:
  m_LocalPosition: {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}
  m_LocalRotation: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0, w: 1}
  m_LocalScale: {x: 1, y: 1, z: 1}
  m_Children:
  - {fileID: 234567}
  m_Father: {fileID: 0}
```

### Parser Requirements

The parser needs to handle:

- `--- !u!<classID> &<fileID>` document separators → extract classID and local fileID
- Nested key-value mappings (indentation-based)
- Inline flow mappings: `{x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}`
- Inline flow sequences: `- {fileID: 123}`
- Multi-document files (scenes contain many `---` separated documents)
- String values (quoted and unquoted)
- Numeric values (int, float, including scientific notation)

### Unity Class IDs We Need

| ClassID | Unity Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | GameObject | Scene hierarchy node |
| 4 | Transform | Position, rotation, scale, parent-child |
| 21 | Material | Material properties and shader reference |
| 23 | MeshRenderer | Material assignments on a mesh |
| 25 | Renderer | Base renderer (material list) |
| 33 | MeshFilter | Mesh asset reference |
| 108 | Light | Light type, color, intensity, range |
| 20 | Camera | FOV, near/far clip, projection type |
| 1001 | PrefabInstance | Prefab instantiation + overrides |
| 1660057539 | SceneRoots | Root object list (Unity 2022+) |

---

## 4. Texture Handling

### Copy & Transcode

1. **Supported by Godot natively:** PNG, JPG, WebP, BMP, TGA → **copy as-is**
2. **Not supported:** PSD, EXR → **copy as-is with a warning** that Godot cannot import these formats. User must convert manually. Transcoding support planned for a future version.

### Import Settings

No `.import` files are generated. Godot auto-generates these on first project open. Texture import settings from Unity `.meta` files (normal map detection, filter/wrap modes, sRGB) are not carried over in V1 — the user must configure these manually in Godot. Automatic import setting mapping is planned for a future version.

---

## 5. FBX Handling

### Approach: Keep FBX, Let Godot Import

FBX files are **copied directly** to the Godot project, preserving the original Unity folder structure (minus the `Assets/` prefix). Godot 4.6.1 natively imports FBX files.

No FBX parsing is performed by the converter. The GUID table (built from `.meta` files) provides the file path for each FBX asset, and the converter only needs to copy the file and reference it in scenes.

### Scene References to FBX

When a Unity scene instances a mesh from an FBX file, the Godot scene will use `instance = ExtResource(...)` to load the entire FBX as a sub-scene at the correct transform. Individual mesh selection within the FBX is not performed — the whole model is instanced.

### Multiple Sub-Object References

Unity references individual meshes inside an FBX via `{fileID, guid}` where the fileID identifies a specific sub-object (e.g., "Wall", "Roof", "Door" within `building.fbx`). There are two usage patterns:

1. **FBX placed via PrefabInstance** (most common) — the scene has a `PrefabInstance` component pointing to the FBX. Handled by prefab conversion — the whole model is instanced, which is correct.

2. **Individual meshes placed directly** (uncommon) — the scene has bare `MeshFilter` + `MeshRenderer` GameObjects, each referencing a different sub-mesh from the same FBX. Instancing the whole FBX at each location produces visual duplicates.

**V1 behavior:**

- During scene conversion, track all `(guid, fileID)` pairs that reference FBX files
- **Single unique fileID per FBX** (or single-mesh FBX): instance the whole FBX normally. This covers the vast majority of cases.
- **Multiple different fileIDs from the same FBX**: instance the whole FBX at each location anyway, but log a **prominent warning** listing the FBX file and which sub-objects were referenced, so the user knows to fix it manually in Godot.

Referencing individual meshes inside a Godot-imported FBX requires knowing the internal node paths that Godot creates during import, which is not possible without running Godot's importer first.

---

## 6. Material Conversion

### Output Naming

Unity `.mat` files are converted to Godot `.tres` files using the original material filename with the extension changed. The original folder structure is preserved (via the `Assets/` prefix stripping rule in section 9), which naturally avoids name collisions between materials with the same name in different folders:

```
Assets/Environment/Materials/Glass.mat  →  Environment/Materials/Glass.tres
Assets/Characters/Materials/Glass.mat   →  Characters/Materials/Glass.tres
```

### Shader Scope

Three shader families are supported:

| Unity Shader | Godot Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Universal Render Pipeline/Lit` | `StandardMaterial3D` | Full PBR mapping |
| `Universal Render Pipeline/Unlit` | `StandardMaterial3D` (unshaded) | `shading_mode = SHADING_MODE_UNSHADED` |
| `Standard` (Built-in) | `StandardMaterial3D` | Legacy Built-in pipeline, full PBR |

Unknown/unsupported shaders → create a default white `StandardMaterial3D` + log a warning.

### Property Mapping: URP/Lit → StandardMaterial3D

| Unity Property | Godot Property | Conversion |
|---|---|---|
| `_BaseColor` | `albedo_color` | Direct RGBA mapping |
| `_BaseMap` | `albedo_texture` | Texture reference via GUID |
| `_Metallic` | `metallic` | Direct float |
| `_MetallicGlossMap` | `metallic_texture` | Texture reference |
| `_Smoothness` | `roughness` | `roughness = 1.0 - smoothness` |
| `_BumpMap` | `normal_texture` | Texture reference |
| `_BumpScale` | `normal_scale` | Direct float |
| `_EmissionColor` | `emission` + `emission_energy` | Color → emission, brightness → energy |
| `_EmissionMap` | `emission_texture` | Texture reference |
| `_OcclusionMap` | `ao_texture` | Texture reference |
| `_OcclusionStrength` | `ao_light_affect` | Direct float |
| `_Cutoff` | `alpha_scissor_threshold` | Alpha cutoff value |
| `_Surface` (0/1) | `transparency` | 0 = opaque, 1 = alpha |
| `_Cull` (0/1/2) | `cull_mode` | 0 = off, 1 = front, 2 = back |
| `_MainTex_ST` | `uv1_scale` + `uv1_offset` | `{x, y}` = scale, `{z, w}` = offset |

### Property Mapping: Legacy Standard → StandardMaterial3D

| Unity Property | Godot Property | Conversion |
|---|---|---|
| `_Color` | `albedo_color` | Direct RGBA |
| `_MainTex` | `albedo_texture` | Texture reference |
| `_MetallicGlossMap` | `metallic_texture` | Texture reference |
| `_Glossiness` | `roughness` | `roughness = 1.0 - glossiness` |
| `_BumpMap` | `normal_texture` | Texture reference |
| `_EmissionColor` | `emission` | Color mapping |
| `_EmissionMap` | `emission_texture` | Texture reference |
| `_OcclusionMap` | `ao_texture` | Texture reference |

### Output Format: .tres

```ini
[gd_resource type="StandardMaterial3D" format=3]

[ext_resource type="Texture2D" path="res://Textures/brick_albedo.png" id="1"]
[ext_resource type="Texture2D" path="res://Textures/brick_normal.png" id="2"]

[resource]
albedo_color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1)
albedo_texture = ExtResource("1")
metallic = 0.5
roughness = 0.5
normal_enabled = true
normal_texture = ExtResource("2")
```

## 7. Scene Conversion

### Unity Scene → Godot .tscn

Each `.unity` scene file is converted to a `.tscn` file.

### Duplicate Node Names

Unity allows sibling GameObjects with identical names. Godot does not — sibling node names must be unique. When building the Godot node tree, track sibling names at each hierarchy level. If a name already exists, append a numeric suffix:

```
Chair  →  Chair
Chair  →  Chair_2
Chair  →  Chair_3
```

Note: if a renamed node is the target of a prefab override (referenced by its original Unity name), the override may not resolve correctly. This is logged as a warning.

### Process

1. Parse the Unity scene file using the custom YAML parser
2. Build an in-memory tree of GameObjects from Transform parent-child relationships
3. For each GameObject, determine its Godot node type:
   - Has `MeshFilter` + `MeshRenderer` → instance the referenced FBX as `ExtResource`
   - Has `Light` component → `DirectionalLight3D`, `OmniLight3D`, or `SpotLight3D`
   - Has `Camera` component → `Camera3D`
   - Otherwise (empty/grouping) → `Node3D`
4. Apply coordinate system conversion to all transforms
5. Resolve material references: MeshRenderer's material list → ExtResource refs to converted .tres files
6. Write the .tscn file

### Coordinate System Conversion

Unity is **left-handed** (Y-up, Z-forward). Godot is **right-handed** (Y-up, -Z-forward).

Conversion applied to **scene-level transforms only** (FBX files are handled by Godot's importer):

```
godot_position.x =  unity_position.x
godot_position.y =  unity_position.y
godot_position.z = -unity_position.z

godot_rotation.x = -unity_rotation.x
godot_rotation.y = -unity_rotation.y
godot_rotation.z =  unity_rotation.z
godot_rotation.w =  unity_rotation.w
```

Scale is copied as-is (scale is handedness-independent).

### Transform3D Serialization

Godot's `Transform3D` is a 3x4 matrix: 3x3 basis (rotation + scale) followed by the origin (position). Unity stores transforms as separate position (Vector3), rotation (Quaternion), and scale (Vector3). The conversion is:

1. Convert the quaternion to a 3x3 rotation matrix (basis)
2. Multiply basis columns by the scale components
3. Write as `Transform3D(bx.x, by.x, bz.x, bx.y, by.y, bz.y, bx.z, by.z, bz.z, ox, oy, oz)`

Where `bx/by/bz` are the basis column vectors and `ox/oy/oz` is the origin.

**Identity transform omission:** Godot omits the `transform` property when it equals the identity (`Transform3D(1,0,0, 0,1,0, 0,0,1, 0,0,0)`). The converter should do the same — only write the `transform` property when it differs from identity. This keeps `.tscn` files clean.

### Node Type Mapping

| Unity Component | Godot Node | Property Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| GameObject (empty) | `Node3D` | name, transform |
| MeshFilter + MeshRenderer | `Node3D` + instanced FBX scene | transform, material overrides |
| Light (Directional) | `DirectionalLight3D` | color, intensity, shadows |
| Light (Point) | `OmniLight3D` | color, intensity, range, shadows |
| Light (Spot) | `SpotLight3D` | color, intensity, range, angle, shadows |
| Camera | `Camera3D` | fov, near, far, projection |

### Light Conversion Details

| Unity Property | Godot Property | Conversion |
|---|---|---|
| `m_Color` | `light_color` | Direct RGB |
| `m_Intensity` | `light_energy` | Direct float (may need scaling factor) |
| `m_Range` | `omni_range` / `spot_range` | Direct float |
| `m_SpotAngle` | `spot_angle` | `godot_angle = unity_angle / 2.0` |
| `m_Shadows.m_Type` | `shadow_enabled` | 0 = no shadows, 1/2 = shadows on |

### Camera Conversion Details

| Unity Property | Godot Property | Conversion |
|---|---|---|
| `field of view` | `fov` | Direct (both vertical FOV in degrees) |
| `near clip plane` | `near` | Direct float |
| `far clip plane` | `far` | Direct float |
| `orthographic` | `projection` | 0 = perspective, 1 = orthogonal |
| `orthographic size` | `size` | Direct float |

### .tscn Output Format

```ini
[gd_scene load_steps=3 format=3]

[ext_resource type="PackedScene" path="res://Models/building.fbx" id="1"]
[ext_resource type="Material" path="res://Materials/brick.tres" id="2"]

[node name="MainLevel" type="Node3D"]

[node name="Building" parent="." instance=ExtResource("1")]
transform = Transform3D(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, -3)

[node name="GroupNode" type="Node3D" parent="."]

[node name="Sun" type="DirectionalLight3D" parent="."]
light_color = Color(1, 0.95, 0.85, 1)
light_energy = 1.5
shadow_enabled = true
```

---

## 8. Prefab Conversion

### Approach: Prefabs → Godot Scenes (.tscn)

Each Unity `.prefab` file is converted to its own `.tscn` file. Scenes that instance prefabs use `instance = ExtResource(...)` to reference the prefab's `.tscn`.

### Prefab Processing

1. Parse the `.prefab` file (same YAML format as scenes)
2. Build the internal hierarchy (same as scene conversion)
3. Output as a standalone `.tscn` file in the same relative path

### Prefab Instancing in Scenes

When a scene contains a `PrefabInstance` component (classID 1001):

1. Resolve the prefab GUID to find the corresponding `.tscn`
2. Create an instanced node: `instance=ExtResource("<id>")`
3. Apply overrides (see below)

### Override Support (V1 Scope)

V1 supports the two most common override types from `m_Modifications`:

**Transform overrides:**
- `m_LocalPosition`, `m_LocalRotation`, `m_LocalScale` on any target within the prefab
- Applied by setting the `transform` property on the instanced node or its children

**Material overrides:**
- `m_Materials.Array.data[N]` changes on MeshRenderer targets
- Applied by setting `surface_material_override/N` on the relevant mesh node

All other override types are **logged as warnings** and skipped.

### Nested Prefabs

- **One level deep:** If a prefab references another prefab, the inner prefab reference is **flattened** (its hierarchy is baked directly into the outer prefab's .tscn)
- Deeper nesting is detected and logged as a warning
- This avoids recursive override resolution while handling the majority of real-world cases

## 9. Godot Project Generation

### Output Structure

```
output_folder/
├── project.godot
├── Scenes/
│   └── MainLevel.tscn
├── Models/
│   └── building.fbx
├── Textures/
│   ├── brick_albedo.png
│   └── brick_normal.png
├── Materials/
│   └── brick.tres
└── Prefabs/
    └── Lamp.tscn
```

### Folder Mapping

Unity paths are mapped to Godot paths by stripping the `Assets/` prefix:

```
Assets/Models/building.fbx  →  Models/building.fbx
Assets/Textures/brick.png   →  Textures/brick.png
Assets/Scenes/Main.unity    →  Scenes/Main.tscn
```

### Special Characters in Names

Unity allows spaces, parentheses, unicode, and other special characters in file and folder names. These are preserved as-is in the output — Godot supports them. When writing references in `.tscn`/`.tres` files, paths containing special characters must be quoted with double quotes (e.g., `path="res://Models/Old House (1)/building.fbx"`).

### project.godot

A minimal but valid `project.godot` file:

```ini
; Engine configuration file.
; It's best edited using the editor, so don't edit it unless you know what you're doing.

config_version=5

[application]
config/name="<derived from package name>"
config/features=PackedStringArray("4.6")

[rendering]
renderer/rendering_method="forward_plus"
```

---

## 11. Error Handling

### Philosophy: Best-Effort with Warnings

The converter **never aborts** due to a single bad asset. Every asset is processed independently.

### Error Categories

| Severity | Behavior | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **INFO** | Normal progress | "Converting texture brick.png", "Found 142 assets" |
| **WARN** | Asset partially converted or skipped | Unknown shader, missing texture reference, unsupported override type, nested prefab depth > 1 |
| **ERROR** | Asset failed to convert entirely | Corrupt FBX file, unparseable scene YAML, I/O failure on a specific file |
| **FATAL** | Conversion cannot continue | Invalid/corrupt .unitypackage, output directory not writable, out of disk space |

### Missing References

When a GUID reference cannot be resolved:

- **Texture ref in material:** Skip the texture, use default value, log warning
- **Material ref in scene:** Use default material, log warning
- **Mesh/FBX ref in scene:** Create an empty Node3D placeholder, log warning
- **Prefab ref in scene:** Create an empty Node3D placeholder, log warning

### Skip Report

After conversion completes, a categorized summary is produced:

```
=== Skip Report ===
Skipped asset types (not supported in V1):
  C# Scripts:           4 files
  Particle Systems:     2 files
  Animator Controllers: 1 file
  Custom Shaders:       1 file
  Audio Clips:          3 files
  
  Details:
    Scripts/PlayerController.cs
    Scripts/GameManager.cs
    ...
```

## 13. Out of Scope (V1)

The following are explicitly **not supported** in V1 and will be logged in the skip report:

- C# scripts and MonoBehaviour components
- Custom shaders (beyond URP Lit/Unlit and legacy Standard)
- Skinned meshes / SkinnedMeshRenderer
- Animations / Animator / AnimationClip
- Audio clips and AudioSource
- Particle systems
- UI Canvas / UGUI elements
- Terrain data
- NavMesh data
- Physics materials (beyond what colliders use)
- Asset Bundles
- ScriptableObjects
- Lightmap data (baked lighting)
- Reflection probes
- Video clips
- Sprite / 2D assets
- Nested prefabs deeper than 1 level
- Prefab variants

## 14. Known Limitations & Risks

1. **FBX instancing granularity:** Since we instance entire FBX files rather than individual meshes, a Unity scene that uses 3 different meshes from the same FBX will create 3 instances of the full model. This may produce visual duplicates if the FBX contains multiple objects. Mitigation: log a warning when this is detected.

2. **Material overrides on FBX instances:** When Godot instances an FBX, the internal node structure depends on Godot's import. Material overrides on instanced FBX sub-meshes may not map correctly if Godot names the mesh nodes differently than Unity. Mitigation: best-effort path matching, warning on failure.

3. **Unity YAML edge cases:** Stripped/binary scenes won't parse. The converter requires text-mode `.unity` files (which is what `.unitypackage` always contains). Multi-scene setups (additive loading) are converted as independent scenes.

4. **Smoothness → Roughness inversion:** Unity stores smoothness in the alpha channel of the metallic map texture. Godot uses a separate roughness value/texture. When a metallic-smoothness packed texture is detected, the converter would ideally split/invert the alpha channel. V1 will do the scalar inversion (`roughness = 1 - smoothness`) but will **not** modify texture data. Packed metallic-smoothness textures will produce a warning.

5. **Light intensity:** Unity and Godot use different light intensity units. Unity URP uses physical units (lumens/lux) while Godot uses an arbitrary energy multiplier. Direct value copy may produce too-bright or too-dim lighting. Mitigation: copy value as-is, document that manual adjustment may be needed.

6. **Unsupported texture formats:** PSD and EXR files are copied as-is but Godot cannot import them. The user must manually convert these to PNG/JPG. Automatic transcoding is planned for a future version.

7. **FBX import-time root transforms:** Unity and Godot may apply different corrections when importing the same FBX file (e.g., axis rotation, scale factor), since FBX files can be authored in various coordinate systems (Z-up, Y-up) and unit scales. This can cause models to appear rotated or scaled differently compared to Unity, even though our scene-level coordinate conversion is correct. The converter cannot control Godot's FBX import behavior. Mitigation: the user manually adjusts affected models in Godot.

## 15. Future Versions (Not In Scope — Reference Only)

- V1.x: Texture transcoding (PSD/EXR → PNG) via stb_image
- V1.x: Texture import settings mapping (normal map detection, filter/wrap modes, sRGB) via .import files
- V2: Skinned meshes, animations, blend shapes
- V3: Audio import, particle system basic conversion
- V4: C# → GDScript transpilation (limited subset)
- V5: Custom shader → Godot shader conversion
